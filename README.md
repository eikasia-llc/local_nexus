**Local Nexus** is the client-side application for the Intelligent Control SaaS. It serves as a privacy-first Data Warehouse and an AI-powered interface for Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) to analyze their operations.

> **Phase 1 Status**: This project is currently in **Phase 1 (Local Data Warehouse)**. It focuses on ingesting CSV/Excel files into a local DuckDB instance and providing a chat interface via Streamlit.

## Features
- status: active
- type: context
<!-- content -->
*   **Local Data Warehouse**: Ingests raw Excel/CSV files and structure them into a high-performance **DuckDB** database (`data/warehouse.db`).
*   **Chat Interface**: A **Streamlit**-based chat UI that allows users to query their data in natural language (simulation/mock in Phase 1).
*   **Zero-Copying**: Uses DuckDB's direct querying capabilities to minimize data duplication.
*   **Telemetery**: Logs interactions to train future Reinforcement Learning models (Phase 3).

## Data Ingestion Pipeline
- status: active
- type: context
<!-- content -->
This section describes how the Local Warehouse processes raw information.
*   **Supported Formats**: CSV (`.csv`), Excel (`.xls`, `.xlsx`). *JSON support is planned for Phase 2.*
*   **Process Flow**:
    1.  **Deduplication**: Calculates a SHA-256 hash of the file content. If the hash exists, upload is skipped.
    2.  **Normalization**: Uses **Pandas** to infer data types (Integers, Floats, Timestamps) and create a structured DataFrame.
    3.  **Sanitization**: Column names are converted to SQL-friendly `snake_case` (e.g., "Order Date" -> `order_date`).
    4.  **Persistence**: The DataFrame is serialized directly into a native **DuckDB** table. This is an automatic relational transformation.

## Deployment Modes

- type: context
<!-- content -->

### 1. Local Mode (Privacy-First)
This is the intended production environment for Phase 1.
*   **Host**: Your local machine (localhost).
*   **Storage**: Your local hard drive (`data/warehouse.db`).
*   **Privacy**: Data **never** leaves your computer. The "Cloud" components (Phase 3) will only receive anonymized or specific queries you explicitly approve.

### 2. Cloud Demo (Public)
This is for demonstration and UI testing only.
*   **Host**: Streamlit Community Cloud.
*   **Storage**: Ephemeral. Any file you upload is deleted when the app reboots (which happens frequently).
*   **Privacy**: Not suitable for sensitive client data in this configuration.
